**The history of Kotlin**

Kotlin was developed by JetBrains in 2010. 
They initially released it under the name Project Kotlin in July 2011.


JetBrains open-sourced the project under the Apache 2 license in February 2012. 
**Kotlin v1.0 was released on February 15, 2016. This was the first ...**

Latest release:11 july 2023
Release date: July 6, 2023
**The Kotlin 1.9.0 release is out and the K2 compiler for the JVM is now in Beta.**

A new language for the JVM.
The name comes from Kotlin Island.
This is considered to be the first officially stable release. 
At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android. 
On 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now 
its preferred language for Android app developers.

**Overview**

Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports 
both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax 
and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala,
among many others. Kotlin is officially supported by Google for Android development.



**Using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:**

Less code combined with greater readability. Spend less time writing your code and 
working to understand the code of others.

**Fewer common errors.** Apps built with Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash based on 
Google's internal data.

**Kotlin support in Jetpack libraries.** Jetpack Compose is Android's recommended
modern toolkit for building native UI in Kotlin. KTX extensions add Kotlin
language features, like coroutines, extension functions, lambdas, and named 
parameters to existing Android libraries.

**Support for multiplatform development.** Kotlin Multiplatform allows development 
for not only Android but also iOS, backend, and web applications. 
Some Jetpack libraries are already multiplatform. Compose Multiplatform,
JetBrains' declarative UI framework based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, 
makes it possible to share UIs across platforms â€“ iOS, Android, desktop, and web.

**Mature language and environment.** Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has
developed continuously, not only as a language but as a whole ecosystem 
with robust tooling. Now it's seamlessly integrated into Android Studio 
and is actively used by many companies for developing Android applications.

**Interoperability with Java.** You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming 
language in your applications without needing to migrate all your code to Kotlin.

**Easy learning**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.

**Big community.** Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, 
which is growing all over the world. Over 95% of the top thousand Android apps use Kotlin.
